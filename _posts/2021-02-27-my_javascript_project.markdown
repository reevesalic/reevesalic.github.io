My JavaScript project was supposed to be easy â€“ much easier than my Rails project. I decided to add a delete button to my project that would allow the user to delete a task after they complete it. This proved to be more difficult than I realized. The delete was deleting seeded data but would not delete new tasks that were added within the browser.  Sometimes the delete would work for newly created tasks if you hit delete the right amount of times. It was acting very weird. To correct this issue: I deleted the extra function I had in my code because it was a duplicate function and causing issues.
