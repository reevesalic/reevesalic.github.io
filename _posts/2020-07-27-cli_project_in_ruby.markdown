I have been struggling with this assignment for a few weeks. During this time, I had a couple of deaths in my family. I was not taking breaks as often as I should. I was programming for hours on end and just spinning my wheels. I was not retaining what I learned and had to repeat a few of the sections as a refresher.

What I've learned. 

1. You need to take breaks often. It is recommended to take a break every 45 minutes. I am not breaking as often as recommended because I get into a groove and don't want to break my concentration. 

2. I have learned to google more effectively. I have a number of sites, I can use to reference the computer language Ruby.

3. I also discovered that you are not expected to remember everything. It is ok to google (or look up) syntax. All programmers have to unless it is something they commonly use. Programming is similar to anything in live, if you don't use it, you lose it. 

Listen what is recommended. They know what they are talking about. This has been a great journey so far. 

Back to working on my project. Wish me luck!
