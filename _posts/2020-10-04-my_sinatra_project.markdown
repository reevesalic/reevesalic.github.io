The Sinatra project went much smoother than my CLI project. I felt more prepared and understood more going into the Sintra project. 

I decided to create an application that a user can log books they've read. Since I am an avid reader, I have bought a book and discovered I read it already.

My goal is to make this into a mobile app so you can pull up the application on your phone when you are in the store buying books.
