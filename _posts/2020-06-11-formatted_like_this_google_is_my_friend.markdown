I've learned that Google is a great way to understand areas where I am stuck. Sometimes, finding different explanations and practicing helps me remember and understand more complex sections. One of the websites that helped me with Ruby is listed below.

I have discovered that it is easier to google a concept and get clarification on a topic then struggle with a section. I was spending hours trying to understand a section. 

If you are learning Ruby, don't give up. You will get it. Just keep practicing. Don't rush. Take your time and enjoy the journey.
