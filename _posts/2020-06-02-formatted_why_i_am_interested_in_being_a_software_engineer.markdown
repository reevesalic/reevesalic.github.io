When I was in 6th grade, we moved to New Hampshire. They were teaching programming in their classes. It was my first exposure to computers. We did the typical Hello World. I was fascinated. That has always stuck with me. 

I have switched careers a few times but it wasn't what I wanted. When I went back to school for my Associates in Computer Networking, I felt more in my element but was stil not still not fulfilled. 

I knew I wanted to obtain a Bachelor's degree but did not know what to major in. I started in Business Administration but knew that wasn't where I wanted to focus on. I realized I was afraid of switching careers but quickly realized I was not going to be happy in Business Administration. I finally bit the bullet and went for it. Unfortunately, I was only able to go part time due to other commitments but it was taking too long. I really wanted to take a bootcamp. Since I was laid off in April, I was able to switch gears and attend a bootcamp. I finally feel as though I am in the right place.
